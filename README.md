# MMS_FRQ
Library for the FRQ module of the Modular Measurement System  
  
This library contains the code to create a `FRQmodule`-object and read up to two different freuqency measurements from a FRQ module connected to the MMS.  
The firmware for the FRQ module can be found [here](https://github.com/f-zach/MMS_FirmwareFRQ).
